# WillsonAlgorithm

Wilson's algorithm can be used to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). TSP is a well-known problem in combinatorial optimization where the goal is to find the shortest travel route that visits each city once and returns to the starting point.
This example uses a coarse-grained approach to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which means it examines all possible permutations of routes to find the shortest one. Note that this approach is only practical for a smaller number of cities due to the exponential growth of combinations.
